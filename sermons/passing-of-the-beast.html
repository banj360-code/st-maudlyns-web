        <p>BEHOLD! Silenc<span class="sticky-e">e</span> in the pews!</p>
        <p>We gather today not to mourn, but to bear witness! For the Great Orange Beast has finally been flushed down the celestial U-bend! The earth shudders, the clouds part, and the smell of sulphur—and stale McDonald’s—is thick in the air.</p>

        <h3>II. THE EULOGY OF SINS</h3>
        <p><strong>On The Abomination of His Flesh:</strong> Let us speak plainly, Brethren! While he bellowed from the podium, his bowels were singing the song of their people in his trousers! A man who claimed to drain the swamp, yet carried a personal swamp around in his undergarments!</p>
        <p><strong>On The Sodom & Gomorrah Connection:</strong> And who was his guide? Geoffrey of the Island! The Epstein Devil! They were brothers in slime! They feasted on the innocence of the young like vampires at a blood drive!</p>

            To help him live in Sin.
